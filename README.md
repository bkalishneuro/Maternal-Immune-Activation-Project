# Maternal-Immune-Activation-Project
This repository organizes custom code used in the Kalish et al. Nature Neuroscience manuscript "Maternal Immune Activation Disrupts Proteostasis in the Fetal Brain"

The code is organized by analysis: Ribosome Profiling and scRNA-seq

Notes:
-In instances where the same bioinformatic analysis was applied several times (i.e. multiple cell clusters), one example script will be posted
-For the Ribosome Profiling Scripts, Ribo-seq and bulk RNA-seq are processed separately to generate fastq counts files from fastq files, and then processed in the same manner for differential gene expression
